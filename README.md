## 🪄 Never Forget That Link, Idea, or Genius Thought Again

WhatsThatAgain is your **digital memory assistant** — a smart, searchable space that helps you **remember the things you forgot you even forgot**.

You know that moment when you:

- Remember seeing something *really useful* online, but can't find it again?
- Had a brilliant idea in the shower that evaporated by the time your socks were on?
- Saved 37 tabs for “later” and now don’t even know *why* they’re open?

Yeah. This is the app for that.

## ⚡️ What It Does

- 📌 Remembers links, ideas, and notes you add or save from anywhere  
- 🔍 Helps you find them later — even when you don’t remember the right words  
- 🤖 (Optional) Uses AI to connect vague memories to actual results  
- 🗃️ Acts like your “searchable past self” with context

## 🧑‍💻 Use Cases (aka, “I wish I had this last week”)

- “What was that tool someone mentioned on Discord at 2am…?”
- “Where did I read that quote about bees and jazz?”
- “I KNOW I saved that article about productivity myths. Somewhere.”
- “I had an idea for my side project while half-asleep. It was genius. It's gone.”
- “Why do I have 13 open tabs titled ‘Getting Started’?”

## 🧬 Why You'll Actually Use It

Unlike to-do lists you abandon or notes you never look at, **WhatsThatAgain is built for recall, not just capture**. It’s designed to be:

- Fast to use 🏃
- Easy to search 🕵️
- Funny enough to remember 🤪
